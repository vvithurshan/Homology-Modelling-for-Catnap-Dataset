# Homology-Modelling-for-Catnap-Dataset
This project focuses on developing an automated algorithm to generate a large number of homology models using multiple templates. The traditional method of manual sequence alignment is time-consuming and error-prone. The automated algorithm incorporates all the necessary steps for generating models with Modeller, from sequence alignment to model building. The algorithm simplifies the process and enables easy generation of multiple homology models using just the target sequence and template structures as inputs. <br />

The CATNAP dataset is a large collection of data that provides detailed information about interactions between antibodies and the HIV virus. However, creating a reliable homology model for this dataset can be challenging and typically requires extensive preprocessing. As part of a machine learning project, a Python script with over 150 lines of code was developed to automate the generation of antibody-antigen complex structure files using Modeller. This script includes all necessary preprocessing steps, including sequence alignment, and streamlines the homology modelling process for this complex dataset.
